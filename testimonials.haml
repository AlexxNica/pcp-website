                    developer for more than 10 years. PCP's ability to graph
                    system metrics in real time at high resolution remotely
                    from multiple machines is unmatched. PCP provides me with
                    a deep understanding of how the system performs without
                    interfering in the behaviour I'm trying to observe and so
                    allows me to quickly identify differences in system
                    behaviour, balance and variability in a way that no other
                    tool does.
