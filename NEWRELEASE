Process to make a new PCP release
=================================

Steps to create the packages for a new release
----------------------------------------------
1. Update CHANGELOG with release notes, BZs in fedora.spec
2. Tag release in git (tagged and signed - git-tag -u DEA2C114)
   Ex: git tag -s -u DEA2C114 -m "X.YY.Z" X.YY.Z
3. Make canonical source tarball right away (./Makepkgs --source)
   and upload it bintray, using ./scripts/bintray-upload
4. Upload binary pkgs to bintray using the ./scripts/bintray-upload
   and ./scripts/bintray-version ./scripts from the pcp git tree.
   For the RPM builds where gpg keys supported (modern distros, not
   RHEL5): export RPM_SIGN_KEYID="pcp-masters"
   ./Makepkgs --with-vector --with-webjs --with-parfait --signed
5. Upload pkgs for Fedora/EPEL (via fedpkg, bodhi)
6. Upload pkgs for Debian unstable (./Makepkgs)

Steps to update the webpage for the new release
-----------------------------------------------
1. Tweak index.haml and at the end replace the previous last PCP news
   with a short note about the new release.
2. Send an email to pcp-announce with the details of the new release
3. Tweet the new release using ./scripts/tweet-new-release.py <filename>
   Put the tweet text in filename and call the above script
   e.g. text "Performance Co-Pilot X.Y.Z released: http://pcp.io"
   (authentication issues - alternatively use twitter web interface)
