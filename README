*** Website environment installation/configuration ***

Instructions tested on an uptodate F20 installed with the minimal profile:
1) Install the following packages:
yum install -y git ruby rubygem-compass rubygam-haml lynx python rsync publican autoconf \
  avahi-devel bison cairo-devel cyrus-sasl-devel desktop-file-utils flex libibmad-devel \
  libibumad-devel libmicrohttpd-devel ncurses-devel nss-devel papi-devel perl-ExtUtils-MakeMaker \
  python-devel python3-devel qt-devel readline-devel rpm-devel systemd-devel systemtap-sdt-devel \
  glibc-devel gcc gcc-c++ man2html vim linkchecker python-beautifulsoup4 rubygems python-requests

1.a) Install the following rubygem:
  gem install sass-globbing
  

2) Clone the following repos (the pcp git repo has to be mine on github until we figure out all the
right publican fixes):
  git clone https://github.com/mbaldessari/pcpwebng.git
  git clone git://oss.sgi.com/pcp/pcp.git

3) Compile the pcp git tree with:
  ./configure --with-books

This will have created all the books in all the needed formats

4) Create the website:
Adjust the DSTLOCAL and DSTREMOTE in pcpwebng/Makefile and then
  cd pcpwebng; make

This will create the website in /srv/$DSTLOCAL
rsync the content to webserver

You can run 'make check' to have linkchecker report on all the links, but it seems it requires
the python-requests package that is present in F21
