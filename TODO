*** Missing content ***

- Add roadmap 

- We currently don't seem to keep older .tgz on ftp? We should put them somewhere

- Add an "all videos" page which will contain every single PCP related video/link

- We need a visible "How to report bugs" page for PCP

*** Visual fixes ***

- Team columns should not be text centered

- The community image with bees is scary

- Make features page more graphical and nicer on the eyes
  - Bullets on paragraphs in features 
  - shorter sentences and less text?

- Prettify structs and tables and other things in man pages
  This might need the move of man pages to xml or something
  similar as *off format does not contain enough info to do this.

- extend css to visualize code and shell scripts nicely. This will probably be
  easier when switching to markup.  Or we identify all the code spots and pass
  those through pygment (harder to do in man pages unless we move them to a more
  semantic format. Check samba?)

- most external man pages do not seem to exist:
  http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/x.1.html 

- The pdf title should not be the file name

- The html title should not be the file name

*** Infrastructure ***

- Document all the needed changes/steps for a new PCP release (update news.haml, twitter, etc)

- Generate books automatically via publican from the git tree
  This works with upstream wktohtmlpdf with patched qt:
  http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/wkhtmltopdf/0.12.1/wkhtmltox-0.12.1_linux-centos7-amd64.rpm)

  - The pdf books often cut lines in the middle during a page jump
    Due to https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1006796

- Move the other documentation html files to publican or some other framework?

- Move to jekyll and convert the pages to markdown?
